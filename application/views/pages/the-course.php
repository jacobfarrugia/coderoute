		<h3 class="intro">While working as a developer is primarily about, well, writing code, there are a host of skills that a modern full-stack web developer needs to have. These range from technical skills like software architecture, version control & test driven development to the often overlooked soft skills of communication and working in teams.</h3>

	<p>We’ve designed the course with the explicit purpose of getting our students employed, which is exactly why PHP was chosen as the primary language. PHP is one of the easier languages to learn, so we can make a lot of progress very quickly and by the end of the course you'll be at a higher level of competence than other languages like Ruby, therefore making you more employable.</p>

	
	<p>To ensure our students are properly prepared for working in real development teams, the environment, course structure and activities throughout the course are modelled on industry practices, so you’ll feel more like you’re in a startup than a classroom.</p>

			<h5 class="green-border-bottom">Weeks 1-2</h5> 
			<p>
				The focus of the first 2 weeks is  web development fundamentals using HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript. You’ll get a solid grounding in a host of other stuff like Version Control with Git, Frameworks & algorithms in Javascript along with an intro to the Apache web server, all of  which will provide the basis for the next stage of the course.  
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-3 focus-box">
			<h5 class="green-border-bottom">Weeks 3-5</h5>
			<p>
				 This is where things really come together as you start programming in PHP & MySQL to build the web applications which power the website technologies learnt during the first 2 weeks. 
You’ll learn about Object Oriented Programming, MVC architecture, AJAX and APIs. By the end of this, you’ll have a solid grounding in the full web stack.   
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-3 focus-box">
			<h5 class="green-border-bottom">Weeks 6-10</h5>
			<p>From this point on we build on all the skills and knowledge you’ve gained by introducing more complex technologies and concepts, to the point where you’ll feel comfortable walking in to a web development job. Zend framework, AngularJS, Test Driven Development, LESS, Coffeescript and Heroku are just some of the things you’ll learn during this phase.

		<h2 class="dark-text">Why a boot camp?</h2>		
		<p>There are plenty of online, correspondence courses that claim they can teach you to code with a couple of hours of work in the evening. But if you want to really learn a new skill, a new skill like coding that is really hard to learn to do well, you need more than that.</p> 
		<p>You need a full-on, full-time, intensive “boot camp” style course that drops you in at the deep end and teaches you to swim at the same time.</p> 
		<p>It is only an intensive experience, where you are surrounded by like-minded people; being challenged to learn new skills; and are exposed to new things on a daily basis that can take you on the journey from newbie to employable junior developer in 12 weeks.</p>
