		<!-- SHORT DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE SECTION -->
		<p>There are plenty of online, correspondence courses that claim they can teach you to code with a couple of hours of work sitting at the kitchen table in the evening after work. But if you want to really learn a new skill, a new skill like coding that is really hard to learn, you need more than that.</p> 

		<p>You need a full-on, full-time, intensive “boot camp” style course that drops you in at the deep end and teaches you to swim at the same time.</p> 

		<p>It is only an intensive experience, where you are surrounded by like-minded people; being challenged to learn new skills; and are exposed to new things on a daily basis that can take you on the journey from newbie to employable junior developer in 12 weeks.</p>
