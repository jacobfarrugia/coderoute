		<p>Jake and Tom can’t claim that the idea for a coding bootcamp is completely their own. The first coding camps were established in the USA a few years ago and now there are upwards of 25 organisations there who will take your money and 12 weeks later have transformed you in to a junior web developer. </p>
		
		<p>These courses are concentrated in San Francisco and New York, which are the US’s major tech industry hubs, but on a global level, London is now becoming one of the most important centres of innovation for tech:</p>
		
		<ul class="list">
			<li>During the period 2009-12 the number of tech/digital companies incorporated in London increased by 76%</li>	
			<li>The number of people employed in the sector grew from 499,000 to 582,000, which is 2.7  times faster than the average</li> 
			<li>Research done by Oxford Economics has predicted that London’s tech sector will grow by 5.1% p.a. over the next 10 years, creating an extra £12bn of economic output and another 46,000 jobs.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>You only have to look at some of the major success stories like Tweetdeck, Mind Candy and YPlan that started in London to see these numbers in action. All this means demand for developers in London is already exceeding supply and with the growth in jobs, the situation is only going to get worse. </p>
		
		<p>This is why we have set up Coderoute – to help satisfy this demand for qualified, well taught developers. A recent survey by Tech London Advocates found “the single biggest impediment to London’s tech future is a shortage of talent”. Without these skilled people the expansion of the tech scene in London could start to slow or move elsewhere as companies and start-ups struggle to find staff.</p> 

		<blockquote><h3 class="big-intro">“{tech} entrepreneurs’ biggest difficulty is finding staff” </h3>The Economist, 21-06-2014</blockquote>

		<p>The course we have put together, the enthusiasm of everyone at Coderoute and the growing demand for developers, particularly PHP developers, means enrolling on a Coderoute camp is the best way to kick off a great career in the tech industry.</p>

	<h2 class="dark-text">Coderoute scholarship</h2>
	<p>A lot of the emphasis on the lack of available talent in London has been focused on relaxing immigration rules to make it easier for skilled workers from outside the EU easier to work in the UK. We fully support this (Jake’s a Maltese Aussie after all!), but also see no reason why a lot of the roles can’t be filled by home grown talent.</p> 
	<p>This is why we will be offering a scholarship programme to young Londoners who can demonstrate their ambition and enthusiasm for the tech sector, but might not have the means to pay for a Coderoute course. Full details of the programme will be published shortly.</p>
