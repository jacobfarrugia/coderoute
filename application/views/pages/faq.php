	<ul>
		<li>
			<h4 class="dark-text">Who should apply to Coderoute?</h4>
			<p>We will welcome anyone on to a Coderoute course who wants to work as a programmer and can demonstrate a passion for the tech sector. Whether you are a student, looking for a career change, budding entrepreneur or unemployed it doesn’t matter, your attitude and hunger to learn does.</p>
			<p>Because of this we will only accept people who are willing to learn a lot of new skills and work intensively over the 12 week period.</p>
		</li>
	
		<li>
			<h4 class="dark-text">Do I need to be able to code before coming on a Coderoute course?</h4>
			<p>No, you don’t need to be able to code, but we want you to be able to show a real interest in the tech sector and a desire to learn new skills.</p>
			<p>If you do enroll on the course, we will send you out reading and exercises to do before your first day, so we can get you up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4 class="dark-text">What’s the application process?</h4>
			<p>We have a three step application process: complete the online form; work through some preparatory exercises (don’t worry, they’re designed for beginners); then come in for an interview with a couple of our instructors.</p>
			<p>This will be a two-way process: we want to provide you with as much information about us, as well as finding out about you and your desire to enroll on our course.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4 class="dark-text">How is the course structured?</h4>
			<p>You will have 40 hours of tuition every week for 12 weeks, plus time spent at industry events and meet-ups in the evening. The classrooms will be open early and late so you can spend extra time in the morning and evening working on your projects. </p>
			<p>See the <a href="<?=base_url();?>the-course">course page</a> for detailed information on what you will be doing on a week by week basis.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4 class="dark-text">How much does the course cost?</h4>
			<p>The Coderoute 12 week coding camp costs £6,500.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4 class="dark-text">Can you guarantee me a job?</h4>
			<p>The only certainties in life are death and taxes, so we can’t guarantee a job. But we will do everything we can to put you in a great position to find one of the thousands of tech jobs being advertised at any one time. This means coding skills, CV clinics, interview prep, industry networking and contact with specialist recruiters.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4 class="dark-text">Do you provide computers?</h4>
			<p>For an extra fee we can look to provide you with a computer for duration of the course. Contact us for more information.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4 class="dark-text">Do you accept overseas / non-EU citizens on your courses?</h4>
			<p>If you have the legal right to stay in the UK for the duration of the course and meet our criteria you will be welcomed with open arms. Of course, the legal right to work in the UK for non-UK and non-EU citizens is a different matter entirely and we cannot advise you on that front.</p>
